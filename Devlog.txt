Going to work on a level system now! wont be complicated at all haha...

Entry 27/7/2023 20:33:
As you see at the time of the update 2 hours passed a bit more i have now
completed the level system implemented a save and load system
implemented collectables you have to find there are 3 of them per
level and it was no fun getting that all done... also took way too long
i also made a main menu and wrote a few more scripts i am slowly loosing my mind haha
time to listen to some music to keep my mood up :D

Entry 27/7/2023 21:46:
Going to push out the first build of it also the first source code
im realy sorry but this game isnt that big yet the collectable system
works the cookies work the save system works and i got 1 level to test it
all also a reset button the graphics are crap but oh well its the best
i could do for now i will implement more levels soon and more things
to explore you can open the pause menu with P and the rest should be explainatory
for itself i hope
